# Pet Realm Compose Starter

This is more or less an equivalent to the Android Views version: [RealmDiscussionBareBones](https://github.com/Maximillian360/RealmDiscussionBareBones). 
It also lacks the encryption of the database, since the implementation is incomplete, just like the views version. 
There is also a bug where the first loading of the database lags the entire UI. Please find a fix to that and inform me. Thaaaaaanks!
